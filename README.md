```

### 💡 Key Takeaways (TL;DR)
- **GLM-4.7** is the new **SOTA (State of the Art)** AI coding model for 2025.
- Developed by **Zhipu AI**, it offers enterprise-level performance matching or exceeding flagship models like **Claude Sonnet 4.5** and **GPT-5.1**.
- **Price Point**: $0.60 per 1M input tokens ($0.11 cached), $2.20 per 1M output tokens vs. $3.00/$15.00 for Claude Sonnet 4.5.
- **Context Window**: Massive **200K tokens** for full codebase analysis.
- **Best For**: Cost-conscious developers, agentic workflows, and high-complexity debugging.

The global landscape for AI-powered development is shifting. While Western tools like **Cursor Pro** and **GitHub Copilot** have dominated by charging premium subscription rates (often reaching $200 per year), a new contender from Beijing, China, has arrived to dismantle that pricing model.

**Zhipu AI** has released **GLM-4.7**, a large language model specifically engineered for coding, offering performance that rivals top-tier US models at a fraction of the cost. With a price point of **$0.60 per 1M input tokens** (dropping to **$0.11** with caching) and **$2.20 per 1M output tokens**, GLM-4.7 is forcing developers to question if expensive subscriptions are still necessary.

## 🛠️ What is GLM-4.7? Technical Specifications and Features

GLM-4.7 is the latest iteration of the General Language Model (GLM) series developed by Beijing-based **Zhipu AI**. Unlike general-purpose models, GLM-4.7 is optimized heavily for code generation and function calling.

### 🚀 Key Technical Highlights
- **Extended Context Window (200K):** Capable of handling massive codebases in a single prompt, allowing it to "remember" entire file structures better than any previous iteration.
- **Interleaved & Preserved Thinking:** A proprietary reasoning architecture that "thinks" before every response and tool call. **Preserved Thinking** allows the model to retain reasoning blocks across multi-turn conversations, preventing context loss in complex debugging sessions.
- **Turn-level Thinking Control:** Developers can toggle reasoning on/off per turn—disabling it for speed in simple tasks or enabling it for high-precision logic in architectural decisions.
- **All-Tools Capabilities:** Autonomously browses the web, executes code, and interprets data to solve complex engineering problems without human hand-holding.
- **Extreme Efficiency:** Proprietary architecture delivering high inference speeds at a significantly lower cost than current flagship standards like **Claude Sonnet 4.5**.

## 📈 Why This Matters for the Future of DevOps

For CTOs and engineering managers, the calculation is changing. The "value add" of a $200 tool is no longer just about ability, but about **ROI**.

If a $3 model can perform 90% of the tasks that a $200 model can, the justification for high-cost enterprise licenses evaporates. This pressure will likely force Western competitors to lower prices or significantly boost their feature sets to maintain market share.

### 🔄 The ROI Shift & Competitive Landscape
In 2025, the choice isn't just between "expensive" and "cheap"—it's about choosing the right tool for the job.

## ❓ FAQ: GLM-4.7 and the AI Coding Market

**What is the best cost-effective AI for coding in 2025?**
The market for high-performance, budget-friendly AI has expanded significantly in 2025. Leading the pack are **GLM-4.7 (Zhipu AI)**, **DeepSeek-V3.2**, **Qwen-3 Coder (Alibaba)**, and **MiniMax 2.1**. While all four offer performance comparable to **Claude Sonnet 4.5** and **Claude Opus 4.5** at a fraction of the cost, GLM-4.7 is often preferred for agentic workflows due to its advanced "Preserved Thinking" architecture. DeepSeek remains a strong choice for raw logic, Qwen excels in multilingual code generation, and MiniMax 2.1 delivers strong performance at roughly half the parameter size of GLM-4.7.

**Is GLM-4.7 better than GPT-5.1 or Claude Sonnet 4.5 for coding?**
Objectively, **Claude Sonnet 4.5** and **GPT-5.1** currently hold the edge in massive-scale architectural planning and natural language nuance. However, GLM-4.7 has achieved parity or leadership in execution-heavy benchmarks (LiveCodeBench: 84.9) and mathematical reasoning (AIME 25: 95.7). For developers, the choice is often between paying for the absolute peak (Claude/GPT) or achieving 95% of that performance with GLM-4.7 for 1/20th the price.

**How much does the GLM-4.7 coding tool cost?**
The Z.AI Lite plan starts at **$9/quarter**. For API users, GLM-4.7 is priced at **$0.60 per 1M input tokens** ($0.11 with caching) and **$2.20 per 1M output tokens**, significantly undercutting the $3.00/$15.00 token rate of Claude Sonnet 4.5.

**Who developed GLM-4.7?**
GLM-4.7 was developed by **Zhipu AI**, a leading artificial intelligence company based in Beijing, China, emerging from the Knowledge Engineering Group (KEG) at Tsinghua University.

**Can I use GLM-4.7 in the US and Europe?**
Yes, Zhipu AI's ecosystem is accessible globally. It is natively integrated into popular developer tools like **TRAE SOLO**, **Cline**, and **Roo Code**, allowing developers worldwide to bypass the "$200 AI tax."
